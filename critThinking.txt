Requirements:
  
  Single integer member variable
  
  static array of string objects
  
  constructor that accepts a positive integer and uses it to initalize
the numbers object. 

  demonstrate the class by writing a main program that asks the user to
enter a number in the proper range, then prints out its english description.



First Thoughts:
  
    Well, 0-9 should be strings anyways. Ten, eleven, and twelve are the only tweens
  that cause issue. 14-19 begin with the same prefix as their x10 counterparts. 
  It might just be easier to do 0-9 for all four digits, than to code every case.
  The hundreds and thousands can just be "zeroThroughNine << ' hundred'" or
  "zeroThroughNine" << ' thousand'. So those cases should can be separate in logic.
  Then it should check if the ten's place is a 0, 1, or greater than 1.
  If 0 {print<<" and"}, if 1 it should grab the one's place and print it plus " teen".
  Maybe i should go ahead and read both the ten's place and the one's place at the
  same time. 

  Instead of inserting the inputted integer into a vector or something I could just 
  find the remainder of it per each place I want to check. 


Steps:
  
  0.) At the top of the paper goes my name...with the date!
  1.) Create the required class, and its members.
  2.) Find a way to isolate the digits of an integer(with math)
  3.) Make flowchart type logic for finding which string to output.
  4.) Proper method for printing out verbalization of the integer.



Notes:
  
  I know I did this the hard way. I think I wanted to challenge myself.
  A definitely easier way would have been putting the ints in an array by 
  their position (E.G. 1024 = ['1']['0']['2']['4']). I probably wouldve followed
  a similar logic with printing the proper stuff out.
